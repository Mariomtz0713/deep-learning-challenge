# deep-learning-challenge

- In this challenge a nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team had data containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
