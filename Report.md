# Report Overview

## Data Preprocessing
I had one attempt where I analyzed the 'ASK_AMT' column to reduce and remove any outlier values. To my surprise the model scored the lowest out of all my attempts and subsequently scrapped the idea.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Original attempt - accuracy: 72.65 %, 2 layers [8,5] neurons
1st optimization - accuracy: 72.77 %, 3 layers [5, 10, 20] neurons
2nd optimization - accuracy: 72.86 %, 3 layers [5, 10, 20] neurons
3rd optimization - accuracy: 73.08 %, 3 layers [4, 6, 8] neurons
